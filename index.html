      <h5 class="alert"><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE">	Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes was a Spanish painter and printmaker. (1) He is considered the most influential painter of the late 18th century. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected his contemporaries and their historical influences, most notably including Diego Velázquez. 
         <br>
Goya was born on March 30, 1746, in Fuendetodos in Aragon. He studied painting from age 14 under José Luzán y Martínez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. In 1773, at the age of 27, Goya married Josefa Bayeu, the sister of fellow artist Francisco Bayeu y Súbias. (2) She suffered a series of pregnancies and miscarriages, only giving birth to seven children out of the dozens of attempts. However, only one of them, son Francisco Javier Goya y Bayeu, survived into adulthood.

In 1786, Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown, and this early part of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace. Although he painted for many upper-class men, he was officially in service to the 1st Count of Floridablanca, José Moñino. Moñino was the favorite of Spanish King Charles III. In 1789, Goya moved on from working primarily with Moñino to become court painter to King Charles IV, with a salary of 50,000 reales (about 9,576 USD) and an allowance of up to 500 ducats (about 1000 USD) for a coach.

It was extremely uncommon for his works during this period to be put on display outside of private property owned by upper-class nobles and aristocrats. As of such, they could only be viewed if one had an audience with a noble, or if one was wealthy enough to commission a painting from him or to purchase one from another noble. A list of people he earned commissions from would include, but is not limited to: Pedro Téllez Girón (the 9th Duke of Osuna) and his wife María Josefa Pimentel (the 12th Countess-Duchess of Benavente), José Álvarez de Toledo (the Duke of Alba) and his wife, María del Pilar de Silva, and María Ana de Pontejos y Sandoval (the Marchioness of Pontejos). As of such, his work went largely unnoticed by the Spanish middle and lower class, and he was largely unknown in the public eye until several years after his death.

He was guarded, and although some diary entries and letters survive, very little is known about his thoughts. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 which left him deaf, after which his work became darker and more pessimistic. His later paintings, prints and drawings reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social, and political life, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed as Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France.

In 1793, Manuel Godoy failed to save King Louis XVI from public execution. (3) Spain's protest against Louis' execution caused Spain to join the alliance against the French Republic, which started the War of the Pyrenees. The French armies managed to advance into the Basque districts in Spain by the west, and by the east (Catalonia). In July 1795, Godoy negotiated the Peace of Basel with France, by which Spain's frontier was restored, but its portion of the island of Hispaniola was ceded to the French. In August 1796 Godoy negotiated and signed the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso with France, which required that Spain declare war on Great Britain. This placed its ally Portugal in a tough position, as Portugal was allied to Great Britain. 
         <br>
Due to his maintained position as Director of the Royal Academy, and the fact that he still regularly received commissions from members of the upper class, he was very aware of the political situation in his nation. This is the main reason as to why, after his battle with illness, his artworks grew bleaker and more hopeless. This is not to say his work before his illness was the brightest; he would occasionally sketch corpses, as can be seen in his work, “The Garroted Man,” which is currently available to be viewed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.

At some point between 1797-1800 (the exact date is unknown), Goya painted La maja desnuda. This work has been referred to as “the first totally profane life-size female nude in Western art” without pretense to allegorical or mythological meaning. Critics frequently cite María del Pilar de Silva and Pepita Tudó as the model for this painting, but neither of these claims have historical merit as of the time of this writing. Although the painting is fully nude by default, Goya did later paint a clothed version, titled La maja vestida, between 1800 and 1805. Both desnuda and vestida were owned by Manuel Godoy, but when Godoy was exiled in 1808, Ferdinand VII seized all of Godoy’s property, and the Spanish Inquisition seized the paintings, calling them “obscene.” The Inquisition would give them to the Academy of Fine Arts in San Fernando in 1836. They now rest in Museo Nacional del Prado, in central Madrid.

Goya spent the rest of his life in secrecy and seclusion. His cabin became known amongst locals as La Quinta del Sordo, which literally translates to “The House of the Deaf Man.” He was deaf, suffering from silence in his right ear and “tinnitus so severe it drowned out all other sounds,” in his left. He also found himself having trouble balancing in walking. In total, it’s believed that he suffered from Ménière’s disease at first, which worsened into paranoid dementia, caused by progressive brain trauma and consistent exposure to lead, either in paint thinner or as a direct substance to create lighter grays on a canvas. Pictured on the right are three pieces from his final series, titled retrospectively as the Black Paintings, which were done with oil and applied directly to the plaster of his walls. Goya did not give a title to any of the works in this series, or the series itself; they were all titled posthumously.
